Pagemarks are a new concept for tracking your reading inspired from [incremental
reading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incremental_reading).  They allow suspend
and resume of reading for weeks and months in the future until you're ready to
resume, without losing your place.

Since you can create multiple pagemarks they work even if you jump around in a
book (which is often in technical or research work).
